\# Instructions for Windsurf: Business Continuity Platform (COMPASS Extension) \- Phase 1

This document provides detailed instructions for developing Phase 1 of the Business Continuity Platform. You are expected to leverage existing project files and adhere strictly to the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).

\#\# Project Overview

This project implements a fully AI-led Business Continuity Planning (BCP) platform. The product is based on a detailed PRD and includes modular features delivered in epics, covering departments, processes, BIA frameworks, workflow automation, and dashboarding.

\#\# Project Structure

/backend \# FastAPI backend with models and API routes /frontend \# React (with Tailwind) frontend /database \# SQL schema and seed data /docs \# PRD, test scripts, tracking sheet

\#\# Tech Stack \* \*\*Frontend\*\*: React, Tailwind CSS, Heroicons/Lucide \* \*\*Backend\*\*: FastAPI (Python), Node.js (as per PRD) \* \*\*Database\*\*: MySQL \[cite: 25\] \* \*\*Fonts\*\*: Outfit (headings), DM Sans (text), Urbanist (KPI numbers) \#\# Development Workflow \- Strict Adherence Required Development is divided into 5 Epics for Phase 1\. You \*\*MUST\*\* complete each Epic sequentially, following these steps: 1\. \*\*Understand Current State:\*\* Review all provided markdown files: \* \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\` (THIS DOCUMENT \- \*\*The single source of truth for Phase 1\*\*) \* \`business\_continuity\_full\_prd.md\` (Older, conceptual PRD \- refer to \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\` for definitive requirements) \* \`README\_BCP\_Project\_Template.md\` (General project overview and tech stack) \* \`business\_continuity\_test\_scripts.md\` (Existing test script examples) \* \`business\_continuity\_tasks.md\` (Existing task list \- refer to \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\` for definitive tasks) 2\. \*\*Epic Implementation:\*\* \* Implement \*\*ALL\*\* Functional Requirements (FRs), User Stories, and their associated Tasks for the current Epic as defined in \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\`. \* For the UI, strictly follow the design guidelines (colors, fonts, minimalism, icons) outlined in NFR 4.4.8 of the \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\`. \* Ensure multi-tenancy is implemented for all core entities from the start. 3\. \*\*Comprehensive Testing (AFTER EACH EPIC COMPLETION):\*\* \* \*\*Functional Test Scripts:\*\* Execute all Functional Test Scripts specifically defined under each FR within the current Epic in \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\`. \* \*\*Edge Case Test Scripts:\*\* \*\*Design and execute NEW Edge Case Test Scripts\*\* for the features implemented in the current Epic. Examples include: \* Testing with invalid data types (e.g., text in numeric fields). \* Testing with excessively long strings in text fields. \* Testing boundary conditions (e.g., minimum/maximum allowed values). \* Testing permission denials (e.g., Process Owner attempting Admin actions). \* Testing scenarios with no data, or a very large number of records (e.g., 50 departments, 1000 processes). \* Simulating concurrent operations where relevant (e.g., multiple users updating different sections of BIA). \* \*\*Regression Test Cases:\*\* Execute \*\*ALL\*\* Regression Test Cases listed under \*all previously completed Epics and the current Epic\* in \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\`. This is critical to ensure no new changes break existing functionality. \* \*\*Health Checks:\*\* Execute \*\*ALL\*\* Health Checks listed under \*all previously completed Epics and the current Epic\* in \`BCMS\_Phase1\_PRD.md\`. 4\. \*\*Status Reporting:\*\* \* Provide a clear report of the status (PASS/FAIL) for \*every single test case\* (Functional, Edge Case, Regression) and Health Check executed for the completed Epic. \* Highlight any failures and propose next steps for resolution. 5\. \*\*User Testing Request:\*\* \* \*\*ONLY\*\* proceed to request user testing for the completed Epic \*after\* \*\*ALL\*\* Functional, Edge Case, Regression, and Health Check tests for that Epic have passed successfully. \#\# Contact Product Owner: Bharat S Company: CyRAACS Platform: COMPASS
